            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas upon the 23 of August last, the Conscience of our duty to God and the Kingdom to prosecute our Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion constrained us to declare our sense of the inviolable Ingagement of the Army, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to restrain those late usurpers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary power from sitting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to obstruct all proceedings tending to the Kingdomes peace: and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have waited with much patience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the Parliaments zeal to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good would have made those Intruders and Designers of mischeife a burden so intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to their spirits, that they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have caled for the Armys assistance to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, then to have permitted them to sit there; yet all our expectations are hitherto,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114543:3"/> frustrate, and no endeavours to that end are visible, we therefore in faithfulnesse to our principles and in a deep sense of the blood and confusion that threatens the Nation, by reason of the delays of removing the peoples burdens, and clearing and securing their Rights and Freedoms, which proceeds from those Incendiaries sitting in Parliament, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but humbly represent once more to your Excellency.</p>
            <p>That we are weary of waiting and that the peoples growing miseries and distresses pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us not to forbeare any longer to use the utmost of our indeavours to make our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation real and effectual in restraining all those Usurpers and Incendiaries from sitting in Parliament in case they should not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be removed, that then those retarders and obstructors of the Freedom of all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary actings, being expelled from the House; that wicked designe of our enemies to make the Army burdensome to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by inforcing them to take free-quarter through want of pay might be crushed, and the Parliament might proceed speedily to settle the Kingdomes Peace, Which is the
